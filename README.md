<h1>Blood-Donation-System</h1>

<p>This project is aimed towards developing an online Blood Donation and Information System. The entire project has been developed keeping the distributed client server computing technology, in mind. The Blood Donation Agent will need to enter information about the donor and organisation that is related to donating the blood. Through this application any person who is interested in donating the blood can register himself. In the same way if any organisation wants to register itself with this site, they can do it too. Moreover if any common person wants to request blood online, then this site might prove to be a boon to them. This project uses online database to register and find donor for the blood donation. It will store all information about the donor in our database and will fetch the data immediately without need of any extra hassle, and would indeed help the people who need blood urgently. The blood donor can be found by searching and by applying filters for location and blood group. By this we can help the donor easily.</p>
